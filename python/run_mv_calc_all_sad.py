"""Validate kt_calc_all_sad in
src/opencl/ktgmc/kernels/ktgmc_motion.cl against the CPU mirror
sim/mv_calc_all_sad_ref.cpp with an independent Python golden.

This is the kernel that graduates from RIG-VERIFY once the host layout is
pinned.  The two open questions in docs/BLOCKSEARCH_MODEL.md §8 were
answered by reading MVKernel.cu directly, and they are ASSERTED here:

  1. `vectors` is a plain row-major short2 array indexed [bx + by*nBlkX]
     (SearchBatch, MVKernel.cu:819 + the kernel's own read at :1122).  The
     sentinel / vectorsPitch / appended-copy machinery belongs to
     kl_search's predictor reads, NOT to this kernel.  The runner pins
     this by planting distinct MVs per block and by padding the buffer
     with poison values that a pitched or sentinel-offset read would hit.
  2. The reference origin is &pRef[offx + offy*nPitch] passed through
     dev_get_ref_block; chroma uses base (offx>>1, offy>>1) with the MV
     halved (vx>>1, vy>>1).  Sub-pel plane selection is pinned by sweeping
     NPEL and every (vx&n, vy&n) residue.

The golden derives the sub-pel plane index independently (divmod on the
residues, plane = sy*NPEL + sx) instead of repeating the port's shift/AND
spelling, and computes SAD as sum(abs(...)) over an explicitly built
window list.
