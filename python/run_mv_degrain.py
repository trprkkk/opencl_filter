"""Validate the degrain/compensate OVERLAP pixel-combiner core: the two .cl
kernels kt_degrain_patch + kt_overlap_out in src/opencl/ktgmc/kernels/
ktgmc_motion.cl against the CPU staging mirror sim/ktgmc_degrain_ref.cpp.

The mirror reproduces the MV.cpp CPU overlap path (KMDegrainCore::Proc: per
block Degrain1to6_C -> tmpBlock, Overlaps_C feathered window accumulation into
a global tmp, then Short2Bytes + edge source-copy).  The .cl kernels compute the
same result per output pixel by summing the (<= 2x2) covering blocks' window
terms.  This python golden is an independent transcription of the .cl
per-pixel formulation; matching it to the staging mirror bit-for-bit cross-checks
the two summation groupings and therefore both kernels' integer math.

The ref-plane element offsets (refBaseB/refBaseF) are treated as resolved inputs
(the host/rig seam from docs/MV_PORT_SPEC.md 6.1); here they are set so the
block reads its own block-origin region of a ref plane, exercising the full
u/v local addressing.
